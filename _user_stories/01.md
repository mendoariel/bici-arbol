## Realtime Chat App with NestJS and Angular
### 1. Video 1

You need:
- Angular
- Nestjs
- npm
- doker

Story:
As a developer I want the NestJS Backend and the Angular Frontend to be set up.
Both should be run with a dokefile.
They should be run/started together via a doker-compose file, so we can start everything wit one command.

The NestJS Backend should connect to a Postgres database, that is also started with a docker compose file.

And the end of this video the frontend should be able to retrieve a vlue from the backend, all inside doker.

Acceptance criteria:
- Set up Angular
- Set up NestJs
- Start Angula with Docker-Compose/Dockerfile & access in the browser via http://localhost:4200
- Start NestJS with Docker-Comose/Dockerfile & get a basi value via http://localhost:3000/api
- NestJs should connect to a postgres database with docker-compose
- Angular should display a value that it gets from the NestJS Backend
