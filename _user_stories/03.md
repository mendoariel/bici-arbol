## Story
As a developer I want to have the security (atm: bcrypt and JwtStuff) in a separate Authentication Module. All security stuff should be in a separate module, so we can import it later to every module where we need it.

We also want to generate a jwt on login and be able to secure routes with a jwtguard.

Acceptamce Criteria:
- new auth module
- bycript stuff move to auth module
- generate a jwt wit user payload
- have a guard, tha checks for a valid jwt
- make the GET /api/users protected by the JwtAuthGuard
