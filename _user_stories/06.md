Story:
As a developer I want to add a NestMiddeleware, that check every request, except the register and login for a valid jwt and also gets the according user from db and attach it to the request. So that we have access to it later and can be sure that the user is not deleted.

We also should add th debbugin (launch.json) file for nestjs debbugging
- add launch.json for nestjs debbugding
- add nestmiddleware and apply to all routes excep POST /api/users & /api/users/login
