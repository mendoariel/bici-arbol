Story:
As a developer I want to implment Websocket with Socket.io so tha we can later have real time  chatrooms for the users.
For this we need to update  Nestjs to v8 (at the moment ALPHA status), because nestJS Websocket are on Socket.io v2 (which is not only nestjs v8 support Socket.io v4). Also make sure to update rxjs to recent version.
Only nestJs v8 will support Socket.io v4.

We need establiss a connection, we should also validate the user by checking his JWT token. To make sure, that the connection works, we want to display simplea Array value in Angular.

Acceptance Criteria:
- NestJS dependencies are update to v8 alpha, where available, also rxjs
- establish a connection beetwen fronten and backend with socket.io
- validate the user with adding the jwt and checking it onHandle  in nest gateway.
- display simple array in Angular, returned by socket.io
