# Refactor observables to async / await
# Add a new Endpoint to Users by Username
# Before Insert make email & username to lowercase

Stroy:

As a developer I want to refactor the observables to asyn/await so that th api code is consistent.
We also want to add an endpoint to our user controllerr to serch for a user by his username. 
Also refactor the code, so that we only save users with email and username to lowercase.

Acceptanse criteria:
- refactor observables to async / await
- new GET endpoint to search by usern ame, GET /api/users/find-by-username
- Refactor user creation, so that users email & username get inserted as lowercase.
